                           Blanchard recognizes the need for leadership training to be a seamless part of a learner's existing environment. We begin each project with the design process, where we team up with our clients to construct a program that is suitable for their technology infrastructure and embeds their content into an interesting learning experience. This approach guarantees that learners have the sensation of being part of an integrated, tailored adventure created by their company, not just a mix of unrelated off-the-shelf elements.
