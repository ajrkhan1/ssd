                                Trust in the workplace is a prerequisite for success, so when it’s missing, there’s little collaboration and a lot of suspicion. Building Trust teaches how to cultivate trust and repair it when it’s been compromised. Using the Elements of Trust Model, learners discover how to inspire engagement and commitment.

                                Servant leaders are consistently interested in providing what their people need to be successful. They want to make a difference in the lives of their people and, in the process, benefit the organization. We believe servant leadership is both a mindset and a skillset that focuses on serving others first. Blanchard’s Servant Leadership Essentials™ program teaches leaders how to build trust, listen, and give and receive feedback in ways that lead to higher levels of engagement, performance, and human satisfaction.
